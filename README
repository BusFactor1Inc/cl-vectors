Changes
-------

 version 0.1.2

  - fixed make-circle-path. A bug prevented circle creation with non
    positive coordinates. Also, the circle path doesn't include the
    zero-length straight line anymore (it was here for historical
    reason.)

  - fixed dash transformation when processing arcs. The resultings
    chunk of arcs were not correctly specified for the :large-arc-flag
    attribute (it was false all the time.)

  - vectors:update-state now accept either a path or a list of paths.

 version 0.1.1

  - fixed cl-aa.asd system definition ("cl-aa" -> "aa").
    Thanks to Ivan Toshkov.

 version 0.1

  - Initial release.
